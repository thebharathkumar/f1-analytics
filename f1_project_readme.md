- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and aggregation
- **NumPy** - Statistical computations and modeling
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Statistical Analysis** - Performance metrics and trend analysis

### Key Metrics Analyzed
1. **Championship Performance**
   - Points accumulation patterns
   - Win rates and consistency metrics
   - Constructor vs driver performance

2. **Operational Excellence**
   - Lap time consistency and optimization
   - Strategic decision analysis (pit stops, tire strategy)
   - Grid position vs finish correlation

3. **Competitive Positioning**
   - Market share analysis (% of available points)
   - Performance gaps vs competitors
   - Reliability and DNF rate impact

## 📊 Key Findings

### Red Bull Racing Success Factors
