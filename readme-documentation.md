## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the `f1-analytics` project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/f1-analytics.git
    cd f1-analytics
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project relies on several powerful Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scipy
    fastf1 # A great library for F1 data!
    ```
    Then, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## üìä Usage

The core of this project is `f1_analytics_project.py`, which contains the main logic for data acquisition, processing, and analysis.

### Running the Analysis Script

To execute the main analysis and generate insights or visualizations, simply run the Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python f1_analytics_project.py
```

Depending on the script's implementation, this might:
*   Fetch the latest F1 data.
*   Process historical race results.
*   Generate performance charts for drivers or teams.
*   Output key statistics to the console.
*   Save plots to an `output/` directory (you might need to create this folder: `mkdir output`).

**Example Scenario (Hypothetical):**
If `f1_analytics_project.py` includes a function to analyze a specific race, you might modify the script or add command-line arguments to select the race, e.g.:

```python
# Inside f1_analytics_project.py (conceptual example)
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     # Example: analyze the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix
#     analyze_race(year=2023, gp='Monaco')
```

Explore the `f1_analytics_project.py` file to understand its current functionalities and how to interact with it.
